This is the present documentation home **for medical
professionals** who do not spend most of their time coding.  In the
future you will be able to link to our explanatory videos...
which will be linked here but are under development.

Introduction
============

`resurfemg` is a package meant to support tools for surface EMG interpretation.
Surface EMG interpretation is a rapidly evolving field without many standards.
We build interfaces for ongoing research in the form of Jupyter notebooks, 
as well as tools for clinical research. The main tool for clinical researchers is 
the dashboard. 
The dashboard is in a seperate repository [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG-dashboard).
At present to create a dashboard for the first time you need to use some kind of terminal.

If you have no idea what a terminal even is, grab a scientist or programmer, and
ask for 10 minutes of thier time.

If you want to do more than collect data with preset filtering
pipelines, and actually do computational research with modern tools,
please visit our notebooks. You can copy one, alter it, and even send 
back a merge request on it if you feel the whole community
of researchers will benefit.

If you would like to see more specific questions answered in this 
documentation, please write us at c.moore@esciencecenter.nl
