# Notebooks guide

You will see various notebooks you can use and adapt alongside our package. If you read the whole document we will describee each notebook. For the impatient, ere are some quick links:

[You want to properly align your ventilator and EMG signal](#align)


[You want to understand gating](#gating)


[You want to make array-snippets for ML](#snippets)


[You want to see some ML in action](#mlaction)

### Lag lead mismatch
#### align

You can either upsample the less sampled lead or downsample the more frequently sampled lead. For us only upsampling works as shown [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG/blob/main/researcher_interface/lead_lag_match_upsample.ipynb) but you can also try it the other way [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG/blob/main/researcher_interface/lag_lead_match.ipynb)

### Gating exploration
#### gating

Our explortion of gating is shown [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG/blob/main/researcher_interface/gating_example.ipynb) 


### Machine learning snippets
#### snippets

Our snippets of arrays fed into machine learning are checked by hand, however, if you want to cut your arrays in an automated manner first, you can examine work we did on this  [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG/blob/main/researcher_interface/ml_snipper_maker.ipynb) 

Work in progress, needs to be finished for every single notebook.
